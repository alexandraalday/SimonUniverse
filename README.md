#### explanations of the technologies used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Velocity , typewriter plugin, font awesome


#### the approach taken/ technical details
* imported a local font - Crystal Universe
* background clip to text is amazeballs!
* really wanted to manually code the gems in CSS
* amazon web services to host sound bites
* keyframe animations for glow effect
* holy moly getting the correct sequence of events took me an entire day! had to use booleans to let simon know when it was his turn, and when it was the player's turn. lots of callbacks to keep things flowing in correct order.
* velocity js to animate the diamonds on win and restart 

#### main screen

#### unsolved problems/ technical challenges
* when doing animations for hover effects, it was only active on the initial button click. Jim to the rescue with the .hover() method and toggling it active, inactive. 


#### opportunities for improvement
* using velocity for more little steven dude animations would be awesome. 
* keep a high score page using local storage, then display at the end and allow users to enter initials like arcade games
* an intro screen animation as landing page
